## Synopsis

This is a day one, full stack web app archetype for a generic web applications based on React/Srping-boot.

To start a web app, checkout and refactor the code to start the "hello world" of your web app.

## Structure

* Frontend - React.js, webpack, websockets
* Backend - Rest micro services
* Deployment - ansible, aws(simulated by Vagrant locally), docker
* Documentation - "doc as code", documents will be maintained along with code, instead of creating the separation between
code and document, which oftens leads to misleading and obsolete documents.
